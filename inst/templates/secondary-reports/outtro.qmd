Challenge Questions
:::

The aim of these challenge questions is to support interpretation of the
data report so that it can be shared confidently among the key
stakeholders in the
`r ifelse(is_la_report, "Local Authority HWB", "school")` community. It
is hoped that the ensuing discussions and
`r ifelse(is_la_report, "support for", "")` whole-school collaborations
in response to the data report will support improvements in
`r ifelse(is_la_report, "young people\'s", "pupil")` wellbeing.

::: {custom-style="Heading 2 No TOC"}
Approaching the data:
:::

-   How confident
    `r ifelse(is_la_report, "is the Local Authority HWB team", "are staff, parents and pupils")`
    at interpreting health and wellbeing data?
-   If using more than one data source to track and monitor health and
    wellbeing in your
    `r ifelse(is_la_report, "Local Authority", "school")`, are they
    compatible and do staff confidently understand the purpose of each
    data source? I.e. is one diagnostic; for identifying individuals
    struggling and another one to provide evidence of the pupil
    wellbeing context in order to understand the environment in which
    individual pupils operate?
-   Is there an already established meeting cycle in which to discuss
    this `r ifelse(is_la_report, "kind of", "")` data with the relevant
    key stakeholders? Or is a new group required?
-   Will a smaller group be responsible for working on the whole report
    in order to pull out the key themes for already established working
    groups in the `r ifelse(is_la_report, "Local Authority", "school")`
    or will the whole report be shared with everyone fully?

::: {custom-style="Heading 2 No TOC"}
Consider the context:
:::

-   How representative are the data of the
    `r ifelse(is_la_report, "young people", "school roll or the year group(s)")`
    surveyed? If 80% of
    `r ifelse(is_la_report, "all young people in the Local Authority", "pupils")`
    participated that is a very different picture to 20% of
    `r ifelse(is_la_report, "the young people", "pupils")` taking part.

-   Have you considered the number of
    `r ifelse(is_la_report, "young people", "pupils")` taking part? If a
    small number of `r ifelse(is_la_report, "young people", "pupils")`
    participate, a small difference in numbers can translate to large
    differences in percentages. For example, if you survey 10 pupils, 1
    pupil's response will account for 10%. If you survey 100 pupils, 1
    pupil's response will account for just 1%.

-   When did
    `r ifelse(is_la_report, "the young people", "pupils in your school")`
    take part`r ifelse(is_la_report, " in the survey", "")`? Was it
    during an assessment time? When
    `r ifelse(is_la_report, "they", "pupils")` took part may also
    influence the results.

-   When comparing
    `r ifelse(is_la_report, "the Local Authority", "your school")`
    results to the SHINE national data and/or Scottish HBSC national averages,
    consider:

    -   When the data has been collected; there is evidence to suggest
        that the pandemic has negatively impacted on many young people's
        health.
    -   This report is benchmarked against HBSC 2022 data which was
        collected post pandemic. There is evidence to suggest that the
        pandemic has negatively impacted on many young people's health.
    -   The HBSC data is for P7, S2 and S4 so some year groups may not
        have a corresponding exact age group to compare to.
    -   The wider
        `r ifelse(is_la_report, "Local Authority",     "school")`
        context may influence results, such as gender balance, resources
        and levels of deprivation which will
        `r ifelse(is_la_report, "", "differ from school to school     and ")`
        impact results.

Reflecting on the data:
:::

-   To what extent do the data provide evidence of key issues for
    `r ifelse(is_la_report, "the Local Authority", "my     school")` or
    reveal specific priorities? Are there areas of success to celebrate
    as well as areas of concern for focus?
-   Are there any results that surprise you? Are there any results that
    confirm what you already know?
-   Have we considered the gender split in the data and year groups to
    identify different HWB strategies for different groups?
-   For the life happiness questions and the Social and Emotional Health
    survey-are there some areas in which
    `r ifelse(is_la_report,     "the young people\'s", "pupils\'")`
    scores are lower?
-   Are there particular patterns in
    `r ifelse(is_la_report,     "the", "your school\'s")` data? For
    example,
    `r ifelse(is_la_report, "are there", "does one year group     and/or gender group have")`
    more negative outcomes across a number of
    measures`r ifelse(is_la_report, " in the primary or     secondary sector or relevant to a specific gender group", "")`?

::: {custom-style="Heading 2 No TOC"}
Working together:
:::

-   Have we shared the SHINE data with the wider school
    community`r ifelse(is_la_report, "? Can we support schools to apply a whole-school approach to mental health in a uniform way across the authority? Would additional training sessions be useful for this", "")`
    to include staff, pupils and parents to underpin a whole-school
    approach to HWB?

-   Remember, `r ifelse(is_la_report, "young people", "pupils")` may be
    best placed to explain and interpret the data they provided.

-   When considering the SHINE data, do a committee of stakeholders from
    different parts of the
    `r ifelse(is_la_report, "Local Authority", "school")` community take
    part in identifying HWB priorities to take forward?

-   Have we considered the year group split in the data to identify
    whether senior pupil ambassadors (S6 or P7) could support junior
    pupils or whether earlier intervention is required?

Below is a reminder of some resources to support the interpretation and
use of the data reports which are available to schools in the SHINE
members' digital folder in the RESOURCES section.
