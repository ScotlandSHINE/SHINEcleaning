Introduction
:::

Welcome to your Scottish Schools Health and Wellbeing Improvement
Research Network (SHINE) `r ifelse(params$is_la_report, "Local Authority", "school")` report on pupil mental health. Within this
report you will find your `r ifelse(params$is_la_report, "Local Authority\'s", "school\'s")` results to the SHINE Pupil Mental
Health Survey which looks at different aspects of mental health and
wellbeing. The report does not identify individual pupils but presents
aggregated data by gender and year groups to help identify trends or
patterns. It can also be used to:

-   Identify the main mental health and wellbeing issues affecting your `r ifelse(params$is_la_report, "young people as part of the wider community", "pupils and whole school community")`
-   Focus on local needs and local context
-   Identify hidden or emerging issues, or groups at particular risk to
    facilitate the prioritisation & targeting of resources
-   Shape your `r ifelse(params$is_la_report, "Local Authority", "school")` improvement plan`r ifelse(params$is_la_report, " and staff programme", "")`
-   Promote pupil voice and shared decision-making `r ifelse(params$is_la_report, "as part of the whole-school approach strategy across the schools in the Local Authority", "")`
-   Support evidence-based action planning
-   Design relevant health programmes and interventions
-   Engage parents with pupil health concerns
-   Support CfE self-evaluation
-   Enrich the curriculum with up-to-date health-related research
    findings, for example in maths, science or PSE lessons.

As well as the data, we have included some background information on
adolescent mental health, measures used in the survey and how to
interpret this report. We have also put together some challenge and
reflective questions to `r ifelse(params$is_la_report, "look at","consider")` 
when reviewing your `r ifelse(params$is_la_report, "Local Authority\'s", "school\'s")` 
data; this is not intended to be
prescriptive in approach but to serve as a guide to assist you and
colleagues. There is also a list of resources for further information
and help.

The report is confidential`r ifelse(params$is_la_report, " and", ", only")` provided to your `r ifelse(params$is_la_report, "Local Authority", "school")` SHINE
representative`r ifelse(params$is_la_report, "", " and if requested, the health and wellbeing lead within your local authority")`. However, we
would strongly encourage you to share the report with your pupils, staff
and parents.

If you have any queries relating to the report or would like to tell us
how you\'re using this data in your school, please contact Dawn

Mental Health and Wellbeing
:::

Mental wellbeing, one of the Scottish Government's public health
priorities is defined as:

*"\...both feeling good and functioning effectively, maintaining
positive relationships and living a life that has a sense of purpose. It
is shaped by our life circumstances, our relationships and our ability
to control or adapt to the adverse circumstances we face."*&nbsp;^*1*^

Mental health is therefore more than the absence of mental illness but
also feeling good and living well. We have in this survey asked pupils
about different aspects of their mental health: (i) subjective wellbeing
(ii) mental health problems and (iii) positive mental health.

The following sections explain these aspects of mental health, why they
are important in adolescence and how they are measured in the SHINE
survey.

::: {custom-style="Heading 2 no number"}
Subjective Wellbeing
:::

*"Subjective wellbeing can be thought of as a positive state of mind in
which a person feels good about life as a whole and its constituent
parts, such as their relationships with others, the environments that
they inhabit and how they see themselves."*&nbsp;^*2*^

Subjective wellbeing is a person\'s evaluation of their own life and
circumstances and is often measured through life satisfaction. Low life
satisfaction in adolescents has been related to behaviours such as
substance use, depression, fighting and delinquency.^3^ In contrast, high
life satisfaction has been linked to enhanced coping, self-efficacy,
self-esteem, positive self-concept and purpose in life as well as
involvement in meaningful pro-social activities. It is also linked to
lower psychopathological externalising and internalising behaviour.^4^
Young people with high subjective wellbeing have more favourable
academic, social and physical health outcomes.^5^ ^6^ ^7^ There is also evidence 
that it serves as a buffer against stressful life events and is a significant
factor in determining an individual's resilience to adverse life
circumstances.^8^

Mental Health Problems
:::

Mental health problems include a range of feelings and conditions, which
may reflect an underlying mental illness. In adolescents, they broadly
fall into four main groups:^9^

1.  Emotional conditions: anxiety, depression, mania and bipolar
    affective disorder
2.  Behavioural or conduct conditions: repetitive and persistent
    patterns of disruptive and violent behaviour
3.  Hyperactivity conditions: inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity
4.  Less common conditions: autism spectrum, eating disorders, tic
    disorders

Data from England indicates that in 2022, 18% of young people aged 7-16
years old have a mental health condition.^10^ The most prevalent conditions
are emotional and behavioural; with girls more likely to experience
emotional problems and boys more likely to experience behavioural
difficulties.^11^ There is evidence to suggest that emotional disorders are
increasing, particularly amongst girls.^12^ ^13^

Emotional disorders may impact on an adolescent\'s functioning for
example at school and in social situations.^14^ Those with mental health
problems are more likely to have poorer general health, lower
self-esteem and overall wellbeing.^15^ Many mental health problems persist
into adulthood with negative consequences for health, social and
economic outcomes.^16^ ^17^

Adolescence is a critical time for young people to develop the
socio-emotional capabilities to equip them for good health and wellbeing
in adulthood.^18^ At the same time, it is a period of vulnerability; nearly
half of all life-time mental health conditions occur by 14 years old.^19^

Whilst there are links between mental health problems and subjective
wellbeing there is evidence to suggest they are distinct, offering a
\'dual factor\' view of mental health. Several studies have shown that
high subjective wellbeing and mental health problems can co-exist, and
they are two separate constructs contributing differently to adolescent
functioning and adaption.^20^ ^21^ ^22^ Those with no mental health problems and high
life satisfaction tend to have the best outcomes (education, school
engagement, social relationships) but those with no mental ill health
problems but who have low subjective wellbeing also encounter
difficulties.

Positive Mental Health
:::

There are many definitions of Positive Mental Health but, in essence, it
is about viewing good mental health not only as the absence of mental
illness but also as a state where someone is able to fulfil their
potential and reach optimal functioning. This incorporates different
aspects such as emotional wellbeing, psychological wellbeing, social
wellbeing, spiritual wellbeing and physical health.^23^ It is when an
individual has a positive attitude towards self: personal growth,
optimism, ability to cope and autonomy and towards others, for example,
being able to establish positive relationships and helping others.^24^

Positive mental health focuses on building on strengths and developing
resilience rather than focusing on deficits.^25^ It asserts that is possible
to develop skills and traits and thereby improve overall wellbeing.^26^ In
addition, there is evidence of a cumulative effect, that is, if an
individual has multiple positive traits, this leads to increased levels
of wellbeing.^27^ ^28^

Measuring Mental Health in the SHINE Survey
:::

::: {custom-style="Heading 2 no number"}
Subjective Wellbeing
:::

[***Good Childhood Index:***]{.shine2} This scale asks young people
about their happiness with eleven aspects of life including family,
friendships, school, appearance, future, life overall.

It is important to pay attention to areas where there are lower levels
of satisfaction, which may indicate that additional support is 
required. ^29^ ^30^

::: {custom-style="Heading 2 no number"}
Mental Health Problems
:::

[***WHO Wellbeing 5 Index:***]{.shine2} These are five positively worded
questions that, when combined, provide a measure of emotional
functioning. These scores can then be classified to indicate those young
people with low mood. This **does not** indicate a clinical diagnosis.

[***Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ):***]{.shine2}
This is a brief behavioural screening questionnaire of
25 items that measures different areas of mental distress: emotional
symptoms, conduct problems, hyperactivity and peer relationship
problems. The questions are added together to create a score in each
domain according to which young people are classified as having normal,
borderline or difficulties in that area. All the different aspects may
also be added together to create a total difficulties score. Scores on
the SDQ do not represent a clinical diagnosis but may highlight those
who are experiencing difficulties in that particular area.

The SDQ also measures pro-social behaviour; this is behaviour that
benefits others and promotes social acceptance and positive
relationships.

Positive Mental Health
:::

[***Social Emotional Health Survey (SEHS):***]{.shine2}
This thirty item scale measures different competences of positive
socio-emotional health, which are fundamental for young people to
develop to live engaging and meaningful lives. The scale measures the
following aspects:

[**Belief in self**:]{.shine2} This assesses a young person’s
overall sense of self and personal competence and includes measures of
self-awareness, self-efficacy and persistence.

[**Belief in others**:]{.shine2} This is the young person’s
perception of their social support and levels of trust and
connectedness. It comprises measures of school and peer support and
family coherence which are important factors in resilience.

[**Emotional competence**:]{.shine2} This is a young person’s
ability to successfully manage emotions to establish interpersonal
relationships. It comprises of measures of emotional regulation, empathy
and self-control which are all positively related to social and academic
success.^34^

[**Optimism**:]{.shine2} is associated with greater interest
in school, persistence and coping as well as more positive social
relationships.

These traits do not work alone but when the co-occur they help to foster
higher levels of wellbeing and increased resilience, pro-social
behaviour, school engagement and life satisfaction.^35^

With the results from SEHS, schools are able to see how pupils score
across the different domains. This may help schools to identify which
traits to work on with pupils and to develop further. It is not
suggested to work on developing all the assets in a single domain, for
example, self-awareness, self-efficacy and persistence in the Belief in
Self domain at once, but to look at fostering assets across different
domains, for example, persistence, peer support and optimism. The assets
and domains targeted can reflect the needs, interest and values of the
school.^36^ It may also be possible to carry out a follow-up survey using
the SEHS to see if the scores across the domains have improved,
following interventions.

Adolescent Sleep Wake Scale (ASWS)
:::

The adolescent sleep wake scale assesses quality of sleep, by looking at
three dimensions: going to bed, falling asleep and reinitiating sleep
and returning to wakefulness. The answers to the ten items are scored;
the maximum total is 60 and the minimum score is 6. Higher scores
indicate better sleep quality.

Factors Influencing Adolescent Mental Health
:::

Many factors influence mental health and research is ongoing to
understand better this complex field. An individual's mental health and
wellbeing are determined by environmental, social and individual
factors and how they interact.^37^ Contextual factors may influence or be a
consequence of mental health and also serve as a risk or protective
factor. They operate at different levels: individual, family, learning
environment, community and structural.^38^

Diagram 1 shows how an individual's mental health may be influenced by
interactions between genetics, personality, life experiences, support,
health behaviours (sleep, diet,) as well as more structural matters such
as housing and socio-economic status.^39^ ^40^

Sleep and Adolescent Mental Health
:::

Sleep is crucial to both physical and mental health and wellbeing and
adolescents need sleep to function well. There's a relationship between
sleep and mental health: lack of sleep is associated with many mental
health conditions and lack of sleep can contribute to poor mental
health.

Inadequate sleep has a range of negative outcomes on adolescents
including adverse impacts on mood, attention and school performance to
other aspects such as mental health, risky behaviour and weight gain.^41^ ^42^
Severe lack of sleep has been associated with greater interpersonal
problems, lower life satisfaction, lower self-esteem and higher
incidence of drug use.^43^ Chronic sleep loss is therefore considered an
important public health issue.^44^

The quality of sleep is also very important, with average sleep quality
being more positively related to health, affect balance, life
satisfaction, and negative moods and feelings than average sleep
quantity.^45^ ^46^

::: {custom-style="Heading 2 no number"}
School and Adolescent Mental Health
:::

Young people spend a significant amount of time in school, and it is an
important sphere of influence. The school environment can positively
impact on adolescent health and potentially mitigate the detrimental
effects of other social factors.^47^

School connectedness and the extent to which pupils feel accepted,
respected, included, cared for and supported by others in the school
environment both as an individual and in terms of their, learning, plays
an important part in adolescent wellbeing.^48^ There is some evidence to
suggest that school connectedness serves as a protective factor against
risk behaviours^49^ and is an important determinant of adolescent mental
health.^50^ In particular, school connectedness is associated with healthier
behaviours such as being a less frequent smoker and cannabis user, less
likely to binge drink^51^ and more likely to meet physical activity
guidelines, as well as having fewer depressive symptoms.^52^ Better
relationships with school staff and peers are also associated with
positive subjective wellbeing.^53^ A sense of belonging to school has also
been associated with increased academic motivation, participation and
school engagement.^54^

In contrast, high levels of school pressure are associated with higher
levels of risky behaviour and poorer mental health. ^55^ ^56^ Young people who
feel under pressure to perform well academically are more likely to
report depressive symptoms and lower life satisfaction.^57^
