Introduction
:::

Welcome to your Scottish Schools Health and Wellbeing Improvement
Research Network (SHINE) `r ifelse(params$is_la_report, cluster_label, "school")` report on pupil mental health. Within this
report you will find your `r ifelse(params$is_la_report, paste0(cluster_label, "\'s"), "school\'s")` results to the SHINE Pupil Mental
Health Survey which looks at different aspects of mental health and
wellbeing. The report does not identify individual pupils but presents
aggregated data by gender and year groups to help identify trends or
patterns. It can also be used to:

-   Identify the main mental health and wellbeing issues affecting your
    `r ifelse(params$is_la_report, "young people as part of the wider community", "pupils and whole school community")`
-   Focus on local needs and local context
-   Identify hidden or emerging issues, or groups at particular risk to
    facilitate the prioritisation & targeting of resources
-   Shape your `r ifelse(params$is_la_report, cluster_label, "school")` improvement plan`r ifelse(params$is_la_report, " and staff programme", "")`
-   Promote pupil voice and shared decision-making `r ifelse(params$is_la_report, paste0("as part of the whole-school approach strategy across the schools in the ", cluster_label), "")`
-   Support evidence-based action planning
-   Design relevant health programmes and interventions
-   Engage parents with pupil health concerns
-   Support CfE self-evaluation
-   Enrich the curriculum with up-to-date health-related research
    findings, for example in maths, science or PSE lessons.

As well as the data, we have included some background information on
adolescent mental health, measures used in the survey and how to
interpret this report. We have also put together some challenge and
reflective questions to `r ifelse(params$is_la_report, "look at","consider")` 
when reviewing your `r ifelse(params$is_la_report, paste0(cluster_label, "\'s"), "school\'s")` 
data; this is not intended to be
prescriptive in approach but to serve as a guide to assist you and
colleagues. There is also a list of resources for further information
and help.

The report is confidential`r ifelse(params$is_la_report, " and", ", only")` provided to your`r ifelse(params$is_la_report, "", " school's")` SHINE
representative`r ifelse(params$is_la_report, "", " and if requested, the health and wellbeing lead within your local authority")`. However, we
would strongly encourage you to share the report with your pupils, staff
and parents.

If you have any queries relating to the report or would like to tell us
how you\'re using this data in your school, please contact Dawn
Haughton, the SHINE Network Manager, <Dawn.Haughton@glasgow.ac.uk>.

Mental Health and Wellbeing
:::

Mental wellbeing, one of the Scottish Government's public health
priorities is defined as:

*"\...both feeling good and functioning effectively, maintaining
positive relationships and living a life that has a sense of purpose. It
is shaped by our life circumstances, our relationships and our ability
to control or adapt to the adverse circumstances we face."*&nbsp;^*1*^

Mental health is therefore more than the absence of mental illness but
also feeling good and living well. We have in this survey asked pupils
about different aspects of their mental health: (i) subjective wellbeing
(ii) mental health problems and (iii) positive mental health.

The following sections explain these aspects of mental health, why they
are important in adolescence and how they are measured in the SHINE
survey.

Subjective Wellbeing
:::

*"Subjective wellbeing can be thought of as a positive state of mind in
which a person feels good about life as a whole and its constituent
parts, such as their relationships with others, the environments that
they inhabit and how they see themselves."*&nbsp;^*2*^

Subjective wellbeing is a person\'s evaluation of their own life and
circumstances and is often measured through life satisfaction. Low life
satisfaction in adolescents has been related to behaviours such as
substance use, depression, fighting and delinquency.^3^ In contrast, high
life satisfaction has been linked to enhanced coping, self-efficacy,
self-esteem, positive self-concept and purpose in life as well as
involvement in meaningful pro-social activities. It is also linked to
lower psychopathological externalising and internalising behaviour.^4^
Young people with high subjective wellbeing have more favourable
academic, social and physical health outcomes.^5^ ^6^ ^7^ There is also evidence 
that it serves as a buffer against stressful life events and is a significant
factor in determining an individual's resilience to adverse life
circumstances.^8^

Mental Health Problems
:::

Mental health problems include a range of feelings and conditions, which
may reflect an underlying mental illness. In adolescents, they broadly
fall into four main groups:^9^

1.  Emotional conditions: anxiety, depression, mania and bipolar
    affective disorder
2.  Behavioural or conduct conditions: repetitive and persistent
    patterns of disruptive and violent behaviour
3.  Hyperactivity conditions: inattention, impulsivity and hyperactivity
4.  Less common conditions: autism spectrum, eating disorders, tic
    disorders

Data from England indicates that in 2022, 18% of young people aged 7-16
years old have a mental health condition.^10^ The most prevalent conditions
are emotional and behavioural; with girls more likely to experience
emotional problems and boys more likely to experience behavioural
difficulties.^11^ There is evidence to suggest that emotional disorders are
increasing, particularly amongst girls.^12^ ^13^

Emotional disorders may impact on an adolescent\'s functioning for
example at school and in social situations.^14^ Those with mental health
problems are more likely to have poorer general health, lower
self-esteem and overall wellbeing.^15^ Many mental health problems persist
into adulthood with negative consequences for health, social and
economic outcomes.^16^ ^17^

Adolescence is a critical time for young people to develop the
socio-emotional capabilities to equip them for good health and wellbeing
in adulthood.^18^ At the same time, it is a period of vulnerability; nearly
half of all life-time mental health conditions occur by 14 years old.^19^

Whilst there are links between mental health problems and subjective
wellbeing there is evidence to suggest they are distinct, offering a
\'dual factor\' view of mental health. Several studies have shown that
high subjective wellbeing and mental health problems can co-exist, and
they are two separate constructs contributing differently to adolescent
functioning and adaption.^20^ ^21^ ^22^ Those with no mental health problems and high
life satisfaction tend to have the best outcomes (education, school
engagement, social relationships) but those with no mental ill health
problems but who have low subjective wellbeing also encounter
difficulties.

Positive Mental Health
:::

There are many definitions of Positive Mental Health but, in essence, it
is about viewing good mental health not only as the absence of mental
illness but also as a state where someone is able to fulfil their
potential and reach optimal functioning. This incorporates different
aspects such as emotional wellbeing, psychological wellbeing, social
wellbeing, spiritual wellbeing and physical health.^23^ It is when an
individual has a positive attitude towards self: personal growth,
optimism, ability to cope and autonomy and towards others, for example,
being able to establish positive relationships and helping others.^24^

Positive mental health focuses on building on strengths and developing
resilience rather than focusing on deficits.^25^ It asserts that is possible
to develop skills and traits and thereby improve overall wellbeing.^26^ In
addition, there is evidence of a cumulative effect, that is, if an
individual has multiple positive traits, this leads to increased levels
of wellbeing.^27^ ^28^

Measuring Mental Health in the SHINE Survey
:::

Subjective Wellbeing
:::

[***Good Childhood Index:***]{.shine2} This scale asks young people
about their happiness with eleven aspects of life including family,
friendships, school, appearance, future, life overall.

It is important to pay attention to areas where there are lower levels
of satisfaction, which may indicate that additional support is 
required. ^29^ ^30^

::: {custom-style="Heading 2 no number"}
Mental Health Problems
:::

[***WHO Wellbeing 5 Index:***]{.shine2} These are five positively worded
questions that, when combined, provide a measure of emotional
functioning. These scores can then be classified to indicate those young
people with low mood. This **does not** indicate a clinical diagnosis.

[***Me and My Feelings:***]{.shine2} These 16 questions are measures of
emotional and behavioural mental health. The questions are combined into
two separate scales and scored according to pre-determined cut-offs,
with pupils classified as having 'normal' or 'elevated' difficulties in
that area. The Me and My Feelings classifications **do not** indicate a
clinical diagnosis but highlight that pupils in the elevated group may
experience difficulties.

::: {custom-style="Heading 2 no number"}
Positive Mental Health
:::

[***Social Emotional Health Survey (SEHS):***]{.shine2} This is a
20-item measure of "co-vitality", which is the co-occurrence of multiple
positive psychological traits of gratitude, optimism, zest and
persistence. When these traits co-occur (co-vitality) they are associated
with increased resilience, pro-social behaviour and school engagement
and satisfaction.^31^ The traits are seen to be related to different aspects
of wellbeing in adolescents:

[**Gratitude**]{.shine2} is associated with increased life satisfaction and
social interaction including perception of support and providing support
to others as well as academic achievement.

[**Optimism**]{.shine2} is associated with greater interest in school,
persistence and coping as well as more positive social relationships.

[**Zest**]{.shine2} has a positive association with relationships with
others, improved emotional wellbeing and autonomy.

[**Persistence**]{.shine2} has been shown to increase learning, mediating
the relationship between motivation and performance.^32^

[**Pro-social behaviour**:]{.shine2} This refers to behaviour that benefits
others and promotes social acceptance and relationships. It does not
form part of the "co-vitality" score but there is an association between
high levels of pro-social behaviour and high levels of co-vitality.

With the results from SEHS, schools are able to see how pupils score
across the different domains. This may help schools to identify which
traits to work on with pupils and to develop further. This does not
necessarily mean focusing on the lowest scoring traits, but selecting
ones that reflect local needs, interest and values. It is advised to
concentrate on developing one particular trait at a time, rather than
looking at all four at once. It may also be possible to carry out a
follow-up survey using the SEHS to see if the scores across the domains
and the overall co-vitality score have improved, following interventions.^33^

Factors Influencing Adolescent Mental Health
:::

Many factors influence mental health and research is ongoing to
understand better this complex field. An individual's mental health and
wellbeing are determined by environmental, social and individual
factors and how they interact.^34^ Contextual factors may influence or be a
consequence of mental health and also serve as a risk or protective
factor. They operate at different levels: individual, family, learning
environment, community and structural.^35^

Diagram 1 shows how an individual's mental health may be influenced by
interactions between genetics, personality, life experiences, support,
health behaviours (sleep, diet,) as well as more structural matters such
as housing and socio-economic status.^36^ ^37^

School and Adolescent Mental Health
:::

Young people spend a significant amount of time in school, and it is an
important sphere of influence. The school environment can positively
impact on adolescent health and potentially mitigate the detrimental
effects of other social factors.^38^

School connectedness and the extent to which pupils feel accepted,
respected, included, cared for and supported by others in the school
environment both as an individual and in terms of their, learning, plays
an important part in adolescent wellbeing.^39^ There is some evidence to
suggest that school connectedness serves as a protective factor against
risk behaviours^40^ and is an important determinant of adolescent mental
health.^41^ In particular, school connectedness is associated with healthier
behaviours such as being a less frequent smoker and cannabis user, less
likely to binge drink^42^ and more likely to meet physical activity
guidelines, as well as having fewer depressive symptoms.^43^ Better
relationships with school staff and peers are also associated with
positive subjective wellbeing. A sense of belonging to school has also
been associated with increased academic motivation, participation and
school engagement.^44^

In contrast, high levels of school pressure are associated with higher
levels of risky behaviour and poorer mental health. Young people who
feel under pressure to perform well academically are more likely to
report depressive symptoms and lower life satisfaction.^45^
